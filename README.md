Once you have cloned/downloaded the website code to your computer, login to Google Drive using the above information and open ```Web Files```. On your computer, open your file browser, navigate to wherever you downloaded this repository, and continue further to ```aggc-web/wdbinsite/wdbinsite/static```. Here, you will drag and drop the ```files``` folder in order to download the data to the correct file location. It may take a few mintues, as it is >3 GB.
